# Comparative Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Models on PM2.5 Concentration in Beijing

In this project, we built a spatial-temporal model to predict PM2.5 in Beijing based on the air quality data and meteorology data from 2017-01-31 to 2018-01-31 of several monitoring stations in Beijing. In addition, in order to analyze the Beijing air pollutants in the district scale, we also get the geographical boundaries data of all the districts in Beijing.

This projects consist of five major parts: 
* Data Introduction
* Data Cleaning
* Time Series Analysis (ARIMA, Linear Regressiona and Gussian Process, Bayesian Gussian Process, Random Forest)
* Spatial Analysis (Area Models, CAR and SAR Models, Bayesian CAR and SAR Models, Spatial GLM)
* Spatial-temporal Analysis.

A few data visualization examples are shown as follows:
